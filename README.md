### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Joshua, but everyone calls me Josh.

I've been working on Making my digital portfolio and other React based projects.

I typically design and build applications that solve or simplify a process that I personally use.

#### Tech Stack:
My main tech stack is `JavaScript`, `React`, `Node`, `Express JS`, `MongoDB`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

I'm currently expanding my skill set, and looking to learn `TypeScript` and `Java`.

Projects might be made public and pinned, eventually... 😅
