 ## Hi there 👋

# My name is Joshua, but feel free to call me Josh.

I've been working on Making my digital portfolio and other React Components.

I typically design and build applications that solve or simplify a process that I'd personally use.

# Tech Stack:
My main tech stack is JavaScript, React, Node, Express JS, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS.

I'm currently expanding my skill set, and looking to learn TypeScript and Java.

Projects will be made public and pinned eventually...
