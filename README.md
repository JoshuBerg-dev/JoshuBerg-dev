### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Joshua, but everyone calls me Josh.

I've been working on Making my digital portfolio and other React based projects.

I make things that I'd personally use.

#### Tech Stack:
My main tech stack is `JavaScript`, `React`, `Node`, `Express JS`, `MongoDB`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

I'm currently expanding my skill set, and checking out `TypeScript`, and `Lua`.

Projects might be made public and pinned, if I feel like it... 😅
